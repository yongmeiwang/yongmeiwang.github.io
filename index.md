Hi, This is my blog page on GitHub, created on Dec 21, 2021
I plan to use this to blog what I am doing on GitHub

I created this by following the tutorial given at [this blog](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)

The limited git commands that I use to push/download between gitHub and my Mac are:
git clone,
git add "files",
git commit -a -m "comments"
git push
