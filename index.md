Hi, This is my blog page on GitHub, created on Dec 21, 2021
I plan to use this to blog what I am doing on GitHub

I created this by following the tutorial given at [this blog] (https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)

The limited git commands that I use to push/download between gitHub and my Mac are:
git clone,--clone the respository on gitHub on your local computer
git add "files" --add files in your local directory
git commit -a -c "comments" ---
git push
