I have been using Mendeley since 2010 and have also made my students to use mendeley. Mendeley was such a nice reference manager and it was free. However, ever since Elsevier bought Mendeley, its getting bad. I had a mendeley desktop version installed on my computer and have always used Mendeley desktop version. Now Mendeley desktop version will no longer be offered! My students were not able to install mendeley desktop, instead they had to use mendeley reference manager, which was useless. 

So I finally decided to switch to Zotero. Zotero looked almost same as mendeley desktop version. That was the reason I decided to switch. If you are like me, wondering how to import all references in my mendeley desktop to Zotero, you will probably google and find out you can import only online version of mendeley. Actually that was misleading. There is another simple way. If you have mendeley desktop, just output your mendeley to RIS, and then import it through Zotero. Viola, You got all your references back! More, if you let zotero just make link to these pdf file files, you don't need to use up extra storage and you get all these pdf files linked properly. So do not let solutions you found on google mislead you. You can import mendeley references into your zotero easily if you had Mendeley desktop installed.
