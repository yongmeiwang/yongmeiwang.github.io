# I am trying to understand the ROC curve.
So you have a sample N0, in which N+ is diseased, N- is healthy.
You perform a test. The test will say sample is diseased, and some is not.

You can make a 2x2 table.
    	     Disease
	     +	    -
    __________________
    
   Test  + |  TP     FP


   	 - |  FN     TN

  ______________________

But laboratory is based on some cut off. Cut off determines the clinical sensitivity. Sensitivity is defined as true positive to all with disease. In another word, 
Sensitivity is defined true positive rate, which is = TP/(TP+FN)

You want 100% sensitivty, when FN=0


Specificity is fraction of true negatives to all without disease. So this is defined as TN/(FP+TN).

1- specificity = 1- TN/(FP+TN) = FP/(FP+TN).
So 1- specificity is also called false positive rate.
