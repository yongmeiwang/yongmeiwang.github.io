# I am trying to understand the ROC curve.
So you have a sample N0, in which N+ is diseased, N- is healthy.
You perform a test. The test will say sample is diseased, and some is not.

You can make a 2x2 table.
    	|          | Disease        |
	|  :---:   | :----: | :---: |
	|  	   | +      |  -    |
	|  Test +  | TP     |  FP   |
	|  Test -  | FN     |  TN   |
	


But laboratory is based on some cut off. The use of Cut off will make TP, FP, FN and TN number differ.

Clinical sensitivity is defined as true positive to all with disease. In another word, 
Sensitivity is defined true positive rate, which is = TP/(TP+FN)
You want 100% sensitivty, which can happen if FN=0

Specificity is fraction of true negatives to all without disease. So this is defined as TN/(FP+TN).Again a value of 1 would be highly desired. 

1- specificity = 1- TN/(FP+TN) = FP/(FP+TN).

The denominator in the two cases, (TP+FN) is the total diseased samples; FP+TN is total undiseased sample.

ROC curve is constructed by using all different cut-off, each cut-off value generate a pair of data (true positive rate, false positive rate).
