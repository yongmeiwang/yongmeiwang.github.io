I like to use Emacs a lot because it is powerful. Here let me give a few things that can get you started on using emacs in a more powerful way, so you can appreciate how useful emacs is.

First of all, you should always alias emacs to "emacs -nw".This makes you enter into emacs mode on your current terminal, without popping another x-window.

Second, I always first load in a directory by starting emacs using
"emacs ."
Did you notice the last little period after the emacs command? what this will do is that it will eneter emacs and load all your files as a directory list. This way you can see all the files.

Let me make a video of how I use emacs. That might be easier to watch. 
Here is the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ_cguQ5wmM) I made to show you how to load files into directory in emacs.

This will enable you to use emacs in a more powerful way.
